# Employees Sample Database

The [Employees Sample Database](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/employee/en/) T was developed by Patrick Crews and Giuseppe Maxia and provides a combination of a large base of data (approximately 160MB) spread over six separate tables and consisting of 4 million records in total. The original MySQL format version is available on (GitHub)[https://github.com/datacharmer/test_db]

This repository contains the dataset exported from MySQL to XML by morf. All of the xml files are (gzipped)[https://www.gzip.org/] (otherwise salaries.xml exceeds the 100Mb file size limit on GitHub).
